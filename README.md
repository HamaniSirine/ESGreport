# ESG Report : Project Overview
For a personal project, I developed an ESG report using Power BI and Excel to offer businesses a comprehensive view of their environmental, social, and governance performance. By leveraging dynamic visualizations and customized data analysis, the report enhances transparency and supports informed decision-making.
# Details of the project
The file **KPIsComputationDetails.xlsx** describes all ESG KPIs (29 split in 7 sections) that  appear in the fund reporting dashboard as well as the Excel Sheet with details on how to compute them using input data. Broadly, a fund is a financial instrument used to gather investors' capital to invest in a collection of portfolio companies (PFC).

The corresponding input data to use are available in the first five sheets of the file **InputData.xlsx**:

• **Funds** which lists all funds managed.

• **PFC** which lists all portfolio companies in which money has been invested via a fund.

• **NACE** which gives the classification of economic activities in the European Community.

• **Financial Data** which gives for each fund all companies invested and corresponding financial statements
(net asset values of companies, revenues of companies, enterprise values of companies and costs of
investment, all in M€).

• **Survey** which gives all survey information collected from portfolio companies on more than 100 data points.
